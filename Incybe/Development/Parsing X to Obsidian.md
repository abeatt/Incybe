GREAT tutorial: https://youtu.be/w7p-RJbRHfU?si=Eq4OiWYXZ3xk4fD7

Basically, create a feature for people to create a reference knowledge graph off someoneâ€™s twitter reposts, commented/like posts 

Roughly using twitter api to connect to the profile and query post data with relationships missing data from archive download. 

Using python api & then flow the data into a vastriano title filter to represent the relationships in a 3d visual format.
