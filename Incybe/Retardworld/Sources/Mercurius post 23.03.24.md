Today I wake up, in full knowledge of where we stand right now. all around me, noone knows what has happened. there is nothing on the news, nothing to alert us that WAR HAS BEEN DECLARED AGAINST THE WEST. I was going to write about copernicus...... but found a quote from

[@EricRWeinstein](https://twitter.com/EricRWeinstein)

and the UNITY PROJECT, staring back at me, when I turned this computer on. So here I begin. It is a travesty that one might have only one day in the year, where one is able to say heretical things. "Eric has set April 1 as a new tradition, a day on which we are encouraged to say heretical things that we truly believe, in good faith, without fear of retribution from our employers, institutions, or communities. In this spirit, Eric released the latest draft of his Geometric Unity manuscript on April 1, 2021." The project of Geometrical Unity has failed...... or has it? IS there HOPE? - THERE IS HOPE to recover what has been LOST in the process of FINDING or ATIONALISING that the TOE, is itself a complex process........ Some things remain pregnant with silence, and geometry is one of these things, that in its fullness, cannot be turned into a simple script, nor built with elements stripped of integral meaning. "If that which is true is blasphemous, then it is to the copy that artificer looks". Plato Timaeus. Why? Mathematical codifications, are not linguistic codifications. As such, they represent exclusive language systems, that seek to conform to the overarching convention, which seeks proof in technological precision, rather than in the means that informs the precision of both technological products, and the mathematical codes upon which they rest. If our greatest mathematical statements, cannot realise the means of constructing the most basic tools, used to measure regardless of our frame of reference, regardless of whether we are engaged in exoteric inertials fields, or esoteric fields subject to the forces of specific phenomena, whose causation concerns us with the foundational relation between luminous and reflective bodies, and as such, between the SUN, and the Planet Earth. And even the apparently greatest minds on this planet, not only have to use voluminous explanations of each character employed in a script, they have to expose all of the interrlations bewteen these elements, and then, convince others that there is a FOUNDATIONAL TRUTH, that is EXPLICIT. We have been in this situation well before now. When Micheal Faraday wrote about ELECTROMAGNETISM, and the nature of MATERIAL SUBSTANCE, he did not confine his discourse to mathematical scripts. In fact he, like myself, was not a mathematician. Nor was he a member of the moneyed elite, and EXCLUSIVE CLASSES. He was a humble GEOMETER, and what he achieved, was in fact what Isaac Newton well before him, would have preferred to do. That is, his preference for a foundational structure, would have been, as he said, to focus on the "attractive" and "repulsive" relations between things. Without Micheal Farraday, James Clarke Maxwell would have had next to nothing to codify. And without Newton's introduction to his Principia, which indicated the preference to the Attractive and Repulsive Forces, Faraday might not have been inspired. And without Thomas Young's, realisation that ONE CHARACTER from Ancient Egyptian linguistic codes, is irreducible to one single generalised meaning, for each are pregnant with a host of meanings, ELECTROMAGNETISM itself, might never have been realised in the fullness of its expression, as it has come to mean, since the last great attempt to decipher these forms, in the late 1990's, by Marshall Clagget. "( )", turned "G" 90 degrees, informed the complete body that generates all shapes and forms, from which all arts and letters, arise, as "ideographic" representations. And indeed the Greek term "heiroglyph" is far more than simply a sacred graph. "It is the completed fabric of the garment", from which NFR "-|--o--|-" (meaning: the good and the beautiful) and NTR "<|<|<|>|>|>" (meaning: God) are both intrinsic elements, indicating a complex 3D symmetry: left to right and right to left, and top down and bottom up, front to back and back to front. It is all of these elements, that grants substance to a RULERS clothes, if and only if that ruler abides to the principles of sovereignty itself, which concerns with both NATURAL AND COMMON LAW. These are NOT MYTHS, nor LEGENDS, nor NARRATIVES, however all myths, legends and narratives concerned with cosmology, logic, ratios and proportions and ultimately with rulership, are significant means of preserving the basic elements that concern the "usr" the "uas" the "osir", that later informs the legendary figures "Uther", "Arthur" and the conceptualisation of the FIELD that INCLUDES ALL THAT IS, and was once known and named, the "Aether", all of which are concepts, inextricably linked to the phenomena that is projected from the simple GNOMIC INDICATOR, that is the place SETTER, of the INDIVIDUAL, "1", working from intuitions drawn from appearances, and COUNTER INTUITIVE FACTS DRAWN FROM ALL THAT IS INTELLIGIBLE, indeed a unity of all that EXPLICIT and all that is IMPLICIT. Hence, these elements arise from the elementary principles of astronomical information, which is why our christian, middle and SUR or USR name, are all PROPER NAMES, and our PRONOUNS are ONE, meaning "I", and WE, meaning there is nothing in our minds that does not emerge from the collective of all minds. So what of conventions, and what of "all that is" pertaining to phenomena which is projected and illuminated? For there are TWO primary bodies that inform our knowledge system and its constant construction, and reconstruction. we are no longer in any position to recontruct anything. WAR has been DECLARED, and we are all of us at the mercy of those who exhibit an extreme Infedelity to the FACTS that inform our knowledge system per se. Indeed, this was the case at the end of the 19th century. But here we are. Poised to watch the utter destruction of all we hold dear to our hearts. At the time of Newton, however, the overarching convention which made his truth, blasphemous, came from Papus the Alexandrian, who recast much of what Plato was stating in his entirely obscure manner, in Timaeus, as if he were writing On The Words of Noone. As such the imposition of a PENTADIC structure, given without explanation or reason, consolidated a QUEST to rationalise "five powers the first of which is gravity". Each of these powers, were to be considered as EXISTING in and of themselves, meaning that they were PRIMARY, rather than phenomenal attributes arising from the relation between things informing the causation of this PRODUCT. Without explanation or reason, and without citation or respect, we can consider that there is something deeper going on behind the veil. On the words of NOONE, is the Motto of the Royal Society. In ignorance and arrogance, one can be triggered to react to such a motto, in the assumption that is indicates a serious failure to respect and cite those who came before us. (it has taken me decades to realise what is behind the screen, and for what necessity there is veil it, and what fruits are lost to those who ddont discover it for themselves, and will never stoop to the work that is comonly considered to be child's play...... and indeed it should be, as it is the only thing that was understood, THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO, to be a requisition, a neccessity, for the education and training of the child's mind, to the point of realising what the completed fabric is. We are all ignorant and arrogant when young and earnest, and dedicated to the QUEST set before us. And the greatest CRIME waged against any and all persons, is the criminal act of removing all significant information that REVEALS rather than CONCEALS, that ILLUMINATES rather than OBLITERATES, for this is the DIABOLIC ACT, that separates and destroys, for the purpose of reducing the greater number into a state of delusional confusion, superstition, doubt, paranoia, a lack of trust, and the fear and panic that comes from the threat of OUTRAGEOUS CONTROLS WAGED AGAINST THE INNOCENT. What makes a child UNRULY and UNRULED, is the IGNORANCE OF THE CONTROLLER. So A HERESY it is, to contradict the IGNORANCE OF THE CONTROLLER. but lets return to the MOTTO. And it may take a lifetime or many, to realise WHAT THIS MOTTO ACTUALLY SAYS. NOONE. This is a heavily laden word, arising from the exceptional beauty inherent in our complex linguistic codes, which at times appear to us, to indicate a chaotic system, where one word might have so many meanings that these include the thesis and the antithesis. Its etymology leads us back to Old English, and to both NOON and NU N. And here is where Old English preserves numerous elements arising from Ancient Egyptian linguistic codes, made up entirely of Cosnonants. The graphic from for N: /\/\/\/\/\/\. NOONE is an obsolete way of writing and signifying both NOON (time), and NOUN. [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/noone](https://t.co/oxQoCzSG4i) Google, or Wiktionary or both, prevents me from further investigation at this point, however enables the facts that if explored, remain unavailable: Noone: proper noun. A surname. From Wiktionary, Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License. More at Wordnik (and then makes a "lier" out of me, by providing and open key, on a second inspection, and stating now that there is NO ETYMOLOGICAL ROOT, which is somewhat provided by wiktionary. Thanks Wordnik, and no thanks.) Now a NOMEN, a name, be it Christian, Middle, or Surname, be it a LOGOS or a TRADENAME, a CORPORATE body or an INDIVIDUAL........ GNOMEN: (rigid, upright, fixed body and extends to any object that informs the study of phenomena orthographically projected from a source of light); GNOME: (town or county, provence, or location: point: "." or place "o"); GeNOME: (entirety of an organisms inheritary information) Is a term which arises from one of the MOST ANCIENT TOOLS, known to humanity, known variously as the Rod of Knowledge, Rod that casts the SERPENT that does not Speak, And from it, our science that led us to the point and POTENTIAL for a grand realisation, for an "AWAKENING", that may well be lost to the winds of conceit, as the WHEEL OF DESTINY has been GRAPSED ONCE MORE, by those with the WILL TO POWER, and no GRACE TO EMPLOY IT.

yes I have to agree with you, from a superficial sense, however there is a certain specificity clearly stated in Dugan's most recent writings, that is rallying against the "Nazification" of the West, the "crusade" mindset of Teutonic forces, the apparent "satanic" debauchery of the West, the apparent non communicative apprach of the west, and the quest to stand on the civilised ground that supposedly informs the concept of sovereignty and the elevation of both natural and common law to far more than mere myth. In this there is an appearance of the rejection of a system which functions on logical fallacies, which informs the non communicative game play of the west. Both Russia and the BRICS allegiance, appear to be apealing to the mikndset of recognising a higher power of God whilst not fleshing this out. Is god located in the place setting of the VOID, and hence creation is deemed exnihilo, which informs logical fallacies, or is there a plenum of potential which infers Panentheism, or indeed, as with the WAGNER group and many others, is the concept of mind, or soul, as inherent in all matter, inferring a resort to neopansychism which informed the nazi agenda. 

Nor is there any fleshing out the foundations of the Iching, from Fuxi (Fu Hsi), who recieved inspiration from a flying white horse, (2,800-3,322BC) being the origin of the 8 primitive symbols or TRIGRAMS, and their association with the 8 "wordly natural objects, heaven, Earth, Thunders, Winds, Fire, Water, Mountains and Marshes. Or the development of this system to the 64 hexegrams in 1143BC, by King Wan, and the reasonings deduced by Confucious in 550-478BC, nor of the fact that the taoist diagram was constructed by Kau-zze in AD 1017-1073 or that the divination system of ICHING and the taoist diagram, were not combined or applied to physics and logic, until on suggestions by Dr Herbert Chatley, they appeared in the text of Z.D.Sung, first published in 1932, and later in 1969, under the title "The Symbols of Yi King", published by Paragon Press. 

Additionally the Yellow Bell constraint of the pentadic scale, and the hermeneutics of "5 powers" or elements, inform much of the speculative foundations of this culture. 

So the prominance and precedence of the Iching, that was employed by Leibniz, as a means of potentially unifying East with West, is not entirely as it seems.

So are we returning to the mysticism that is inherent in NEW AGE conceptions of the 7 rays, and their geometrical base located in the Flower of Life, rather than the VESICA PISCIS, and Eye of God, at the expense of rational sciences arising from astronomical information, and extending way back to Ancient Egyptian (fourth millenium BC) and English foundations (ground plan of Stone Henge, and legal precedence of natural sovereignty and common law, implicit in Old English terminology) and the revisions that are apparent in Z.D. Sung, (1932)? 

Herbert Chatley, wrote in "The China Journal of Science and Arts", republished as the appendix in the 1932 edition, that "these methods can of course only lead to hypotheses and the further step is to test the applicability of these hypotheses to psychic experience, i.e. magic......physical research has shown that numerous invariable mathematical rules apply to these, and it is concievable that the general characteristics of these rtules may analogically be extended to occult phenomena......... In modern terms, this states that the universe is a Monism, mathematically related, of polar differentiation, manifest as a sucession of forms......The principle of mathematical relation occurs in the Kabbalah, Babylonian and Egyptian astrology, the Pythagorean cosmogony, and the christian trinity. The concept of motion and change as a breath with antithetical states occurs markedly in Indian Philosophy, and the notion of psychical polarity is dominant is Parseeism, Islam, and Medieval Christianity..... finally the concept of form as a mere manifestation of underlying causes is the central feature Vedantism and all the mystical pantheisms which have developed in the various religions."

It is for this reason that Leibniz's monadology, was based on the notion that the "Whole is greater than the sum of its parts", and that Plato's categorical system divides the STUDENTS AWARENESS of the WHOLE, into all that is VISIBLE (intuitive) and all that is INTELLIGIBLE, and leads to counter intuitive FACTS.

It should also be noted that the actual writing of the ancient Texts of India, occurred between 900 and 500 BC, and that, in the same manner as the Chinese system, pushed back the dates to far earlier periods, notably for the regions in India, now Pakistan anchored to the Hydraulic Citidel of Harrappa.

It should also be noted that Champillion was only able to decode 7 graphic forms, and that the rest was an educated guess, and to this day, this philological history requires serious revision.
