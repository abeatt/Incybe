## Highlights

> legalized 'neurological surveillance' [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-lifesitenews-com-blogs-obama-biden-administration-lega-18e1d60bc58#e5be2e4b-85c1-4a9d-9f55-fa83c48c9fd0)  ^e5be2e4b

> ([LifeSiteNews](https://lifesitenews.com/)) — This article provides a new discussion on “[biosurveillance](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/247d-4),” and specifically the “[National Neurological Conditions Surveillance System](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/280g-7a)” laws enacted in December 2016 (which was during the Obama-Biden administration and, potentially significantly, after President Donald Trump was elected). The neurological (which includes the brain) surveillance laws may be significant suggestions of the U.S. federal government’s surveillance activities and could be interpreted as attempts at such legal protection for “brain surveillance” which would also be described as “neurological surveillance.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-lifesitenews-com-blogs-obama-biden-administration-lega-18e1d60bc58#fdf4bc3d-f675-4a50-89e9-8e9d5f28349d)  ^fdf4bc3d

> Multiple previous articles discussed U.S. federal government laws on “[biosurveillance](https://www.lifesitenews.com/blogs/what-does-federal-law-and-the-science-say-about-brain-manipulation/)” which suggest at least the possibility of the federal government intent of achieving “real-time” “mind reading” and “mind control.”

> If the U.S. or other governments planned on developing technologies for “brain” or “neurological” surveillance and/or brain or neurological control, it is necessary to emphasize that the U.S. or other governments would probably use the most extensive propaganda methods possible to make anyone and everyone think that it is crazy to suggest “mind reading” or “mind control” are possible, let alone possible for a government to do secretly and from an unknown location.
