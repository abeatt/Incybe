It is quite fitting that I am publishing the **conclusion to this series** on **April 22** which happens to be **[Earth Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day)** (for Canadians see also [earthday.ca](https://earthday.ca/organization/mission/)).

At **84 pages** long this is my second longest post ever (the longest was Part 2 of this series at 119 pages).

This is the **4th and final part** of this series which, altogether, spans well **over 300 pages**.

## **4.1 Introduction & Recap**

> **“One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.”** - _Carl Sagan from his book [The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark](https://bookriot.com/best-carl-sagan-quotes/)_

**Ongoing Geoengineering and Weather Modification activities continuously affect our climate systems, the air that we breathe, our natural environment, biodiversity, our water systems, and people’s health.**

The resulting **lack of sunlight** due to these activities also has tremendous consequences, including **depriving us from natural vitamin D**, and **enjoying bright sunny days** at the beach or elsewhere where we enjoy basking in its blanket of warmth and energy.

Though this is the fourth and final part of this series, additional information may be continuously added to it in the coming months (and even years) so as to keep this endeavour alive and kicking.

One of the focuses of this fourth part will be **to press some of our law enforcement (and other agencies/institutions as well as politicians to further investigate some of the troubling findings revealed thus far in this series – which stretches over 300 pages in length and contains a substantial amount of physical, scientific, photographic/video, circumstantial evidence, along with expert and whistleblower testimony.**

This post will be mainly separated into two main parts. The first one will be to provide additional information on what has been previously covered (addenda), updates (new information) and follow-ups (new communications with agencies/parties with whom I had previously corresponded with); and the second part entails open letters I am sending to law enforcement and an intelligence agency asking for further inquiries and investigations to take place.

## **4.2 Addenda**

Here are some **new items** which I am adding to this series.

### **4.2.1 GeoengineeringFreeCanada Webinar (January 2024)**

On January 9, 2024, I appeared as a guest speaker for [GeoengineeringFreeCanada](https://www.geoengineeringfreecanada.com/)’s **[GEO WEBINAR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJKAS8k4UbU)**.

The event provided an opportunity to **[highlight some of the key findings](http://liberty-academy.org/geoengineering/presentations/GEO_Webinar-2023-01-09.pdf) (click for PDF) I have outlined in the first three parts of this series**.

In addition, **world-renowned expert on geoengineering and weather modification,****[Jim Lee](https://climateviewer.com/about/)** – the creator of **[ClimateViewer News](https://climateviewer.com/)**, made an appearance on the show to share some of his valuable input.

You can **watch the webinar** hereunder:

Part of Jim Lee’s valuable input was to add to what I had wrote about in Part 1 regarding ‘**[Operation Umbrella](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5dde4c3f-0196-481d-abb4-a375cc83c6ae_1627x931.jpeg)**’ which was a [cloud-seeding](https://fournier.substack.com/i/137515533/cloud-seeding) operation that occurred in in the 1960s in Lac Saint-Jean, Quebec province. More specifically, he provided some **newspaper clippings and photographs of this event** – with a particular focus on the public outrage that had ensued as a result of this operation.

_**The Winnipeg Tribune, August 7, 1965 showing a protest called ‘Operation Para-Pluie’ which had collected 60,718 signatures at the time from angry northern Quebec women. Image source: [ClimateViewer.com](https://climateviewer.com/wmh/img/fullsize/newspapers/1965-08-07-The-full-story-on-OPERATION-UMBRELLA-1.jpg).**_

The **main photograph** for the [article](https://climateviewer.com/wmh/img/fullsize/newspapers/1965-08-07-The-full-story-on-OPERATION-UMBRELLA-1.jpg) shows **hoards of women with their umbrellas walking in protest to the artificial rainmaking above their region**.

“Life was a big drizzle in parts of La Belle Province until the ladies declared all-out war on rainmakers,” commences the [article](https://climateviewer.com/wmh/img/fullsize/newspapers/1965-08-07-The-full-story-on-OPERATION-UMBRELLA-1.jpg).

Here’s are some **key excerpts** [with some **emphasis and link added**]:

> “Don’t laugh! Rainmaking may have been so much hocus-pocus at one time but nowadays it is strictly for real. It works. And anyway, this isn’t a very funny story, at least not to the people in the Saguenay-Lac St. Jean region, northeast of Quebec city.  
> 
> **They have lived with the rainmaking machines for 10 years and it has been a rather soggy experience.** Rainmaking may be a giant step forward in man’s dream to control the weather, **but to the people of northern Quebec it is a giant pain.**”  
>   
> ...  
>   
> **The culprit they point accusing fingers at is [Weather Engineering Corp. of Canada Ltd](https://opengovca.com/corporation/641481)., a Montreal-based firm that uses generators that are strategically located on the ground to seed clouds with silver iodide**.   
>   
> ...  
>   
> “I kept telling them it was artificial rain,” said Bouchard. **“Every time we turned on the machines you could see a yellow ring around the puddles of water along the streets. I knew that ring came from the seeding but they just laughed. They thought it was just that climate was changing on its own.**”

“Rain, rain and more rain. That’s how it was until [Quebec Cabinet Minister Réne Lévesque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_L%C3%A9vesque#Lib%C3%A9ral_cabinet_minister) gave into public opinion, ordered the infernal machines turned off,” reads a caption for the article which shows who would eventually become the Prime Minister of the province.

The article [continues](https://climateviewer.com/wmh/img/fullsize/newspapers/1965-08-07-The-full-story-on-OPERATION-UMBRELLA-2.jpg) to explain how local services and businesses were disrupted. Outdoor swimming pools were open less frequently, zoo visits were on the decline, as well as their animals getting sicker than usual (presumably because of the lack of sunshine). Tourism to the region declined. **“Hardest hit were all the farmers,”**states the article according to the Catholic Farmers’ Union.

> “The union says the natural rainfall in its area is sufficient to satisfy the needs of agriculture but notes that precipitation in 1964 increased 24.9 per cent over periods prior to 1956 when artificial rainmaking started. The increase means farmers are getting an average of 481.34 tons of water above normal for every acre of land.  
>   
> The result: drowned-out crops. The union has already collected $147,800 in damages from the Province of Quebec and is now trying to get federal assistance.”

Given these statements and facts as enumerated in the article, one has to wonder _why_ they ran this program for a decade in the first place.

The cloud seeding operations (which actually took place over _four_ regions in the province) were **at the request of Hydro Quebec** and its affiliates who wanted to raise reservoir levels. They were also done to reduce the incidence of forest fires, the article states.

The point of rehashing this operation which took place several decades ago is to **illustrate how certain private or financial based objectives can be carelessly undertaken at the cost of the welfare of the citizenry and local communities**.

Moreover, looking at the _outcome_ of Operation Umbrella, it is clear to see that many other sectors of the economy were negatively affected by it. And one has to wonder why it took a decade and an army of angry mothers to shut it down.

### **4.2.2 Technically Speaking (with Jim Lee)**

Now, fair warning. This section will get somewhat _technical_. But, it is perhaps the _most important_section of this post.

As **the very subject nature of geoengineering is highly scientific and technical in nature**, utilisation of the **proper terminology** is required to fully express what is _really_ taking place with all these activities.

**Separating fact from fiction** is essential for an **objective evaluation** of the situation regarding these activities.

I can think of no other individual and **expert** on the subject than the aforementioned **[Jim Lee](https://climateviewer.com/about/)** (see also his recently launched [Substack](https://climateviewer.substack.com/)) to break it down for us in the simpler, yet unavoidably intricate, lingo.

What follows are some **highlights** from a very thorough **interview titled [EYE ON THE SKY](https://climateviewer.substack.com/p/eye-on-the-sky-del-bigtree-and-jim)Lee held with host [Del Bigtree](https://thehighwire.com/videos/del-bigtree/) from [The Highwire](https://thehighwire.com/)** which aired on March 15, 2024.

The one hour, 22 minute interview can be watched hereunder. I will only **highlight some of the key takeaways below** since they shed so much light on what is important to know.

What I particularly like about this interview is how the pair have a **very candid conversation that almost entirely based on facts and verifiable evidence**. Nearly all the **studies**, **papers**, **laws**, and **documents** that Lee refers to are flashed on the screen so that viewers can _**verify**_ **the claims for themselves**.

So, here we go.

#### **4.2.2.1 Jet Fuel Exhaust & Artificial Clouds**

One of the first topics discussed was how the **composition of jet fuel** has changed in the past couple of decades.

Many **elements** have been **added to jet fuel for various reasons** – ranging from improved consumption efficiency to the intentional production of **[artificial clouds](https://climateviewer.com/tags/artificial-clouds/)**.

Lee explains that **black carbon**, or **soot**, or**[carbon black dust](https://climateviewer.com/downloads/presentations/Carbon-Black-Dust-The-Chemtrail-Secret-for-Weather-Warfare-Geoengineering-and-Ozone-Destruction.pdf)** (which is what I referred to as _[coal fly ash](https://fournier.substack.com/i/137515533/contrails-or-chemtrails)_ [in Part 1](https://fournier.substack.com/i/137515533/contrails-or-chemtrails) of this series) can contain all of the following **metals** for which Lee has prepared the following **[graphic](https://climateviewer.com/cirruscloudsmatter/)** (shown in the interview around the 20:15 mark):

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa051bb2-148f-434f-8a4a-e3bad9b4e7e9_1920x1080.png)

_**Metals detected in jet exhaust. Source: [https://climateviewer.com/cirruscloudsmatter/](https://climateviewer.com/cirruscloudsmatter/)**_

Lee’s graphic from above is **sourced** with the following:

> “_The detected metallic compounds were **all internally mixed with the soot particles**. The most abundant metals in the exhaust were Chromium (Cr), Iron (Fe), Molybdenum (Mo), Sodium (Na), Calcium (Ca) and Aluminum (Al); Vanadium (V), Barium (Ba), Cobalt (Co), Copper (Cu), Nickel (Ni), Lead (Pb), Magnesium (Mg), Manganese (Mn), Silicon (Si), Titanium (Ti) and Zirconium (Zr) were also detected.”  
>   
> Abegglen, Manuel, et al. "[Chemical characterization of freshly emitted particulate matter from aircraft exhaust using single particle mass spectrometry](https://climateviewer.com/downloads/Abeggeln-etal-AE2016-aircraft-exhaust.pdf)." Atmospheric Environment 134 (2016): 181-197._

Many, including this author, argue that **the thin wispy cloud formations that [regularly](https://fournier.substack.com/i/137515533/appendix-a-weeks-of-spraying-over-the-city-sherbrooke-quebec)blanket our skies are indeed** _**not natural,**_ **but are rather the direct fabrication of the aggregate or collective dispersion of jet exhaust produced by commercial airliners**; while others will argue that they are simply _naturall-occuring_ cirrus cloud formations.

Lee provides a substantial amount of **evidence in this interview and on his [website](https://climateviewer.com/2018/04/01/accidental-geoengineering-with-ship-tracks-contrails/) that these thin and wispy cloud formations – coined “[Accidental Geoengineering](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/airplane-contrails-may-be-creating-accidental-geoengineering-180957561/)” – actually stem from the chemical and metallic composition of the particulates emitted from jet exhaust, and also from [shipping](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1229857/How-16-ships-create-pollution-cars-world.html)**.

At the end of the day, Lee states, **these are “artificial clouds.”**

He further explains how the “**buildup of atmospheric aerosols**” (in lieu of “**contrails**” or “**chemtrails**,” as these terms are often polarising ones that obscure their true nature) is what’s particularly worrisome.

Lee also expands that the **terminology used to explain these can be very** _**subjective**_, depending on which side of the debate (contrail vs. chemtrail) one is on.

Regardless, the fact of the matter is that **these toxic metals are being dispersed in massive quantities into our [atmosphere](https://fournier.substack.com/i/137515533/layers-of-the-earths-atmosphere) and accumulate there for extended periods**. **That is fact.**

To make matters worse, Lee explains, **many of these particulates actually find their way up into the [stratosphere](https://fournier.substack.com/i/137515533/layers-of-the-earths-atmosphere)** which can be held there for a few years before “clearing out.” Should all these sprayings completely end, he contends, it would take two to three years to be completely rid of them.

#### **4.2.2.2 Is there intent?**

Around the 24-minute mark of the interview the discussion veers towards _**intent**_.

In other words, **is commercial aviation which produces mammoth amounts of artificial clouds being done with any malicious motives behind them? Or, are they merely the byproduct of a substantial increase in air travel? Or both?**

Here is where the discussion gets particularly interesting and noteworthy; for, as both the guest and the host are self-proclaimed staunch skeptics, they treat this **important question** with the highest possible level of scrutiny and examination it deserves.

Lee treads cautiously, so as to provide information that is duly _objective_ and _evidence-based_, rather than speculatory or merely conjecture.

> “The entire chemtrail conspiracy boils down to down to **intent**.”

The above quote is the key statement offered by Jim Lee to Bigtree (around the 25:00 mark).

Lee notes that in the United States alone regarding **commercial aviation**, **there are between 130,000 to 150,000 flights per day whereby 15 million barrels of jet fuel are burned**.

Lee then **cites experts in the field** with regards to **“contrail cirrus”** (which means the formation of contrail-induced cirrus clouds, or the thin wispy ones this author referred to earlier) **about their impacts on the cooling or warming of our climate.**

He specifically refers to an **event from 2010**called the **[ICAO Colloquium on Aviation and Climate Change](https://www.icao.int/Meetings/EnvironmentalColloquium/Pages/2010-Colloquium.aspx)** which took place in Montreal (Canada) in May of 2010.

ICAO stands for the **[International Civil Aviation Organization](https://www.icao.int/about-icao/Pages/default.aspx)** which is **a United Nations agency**.

The [event](https://sdg.iisd.org/events/icao-colloquium-on-aviation-and-climate-change/) focused on **the relationship between climate change and aviation**.

_**Screenshot of the [ICAO Colloquium on Aviation and Climate Change](https://www.icao.int/Meetings/EnvironmentalColloquium/Pages/2010-Colloquium.aspx), taken on April 3, 2024.**_

Lee then cited noteworthy comments made by **the world’s leading expert on ‘Contrail Physics’,****[Dr. Ulrich Shumann](https://web.archive.org/web/20180613142050/https://www.dlr.de/pa/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-2357/3477_read-32301/sortby-lastname/) of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics** from Germany’s [DLR Aerospace Center](https://www.dlr.de/en/dlr/about-us).

Shumann said they wanted “**less warming and more cooling contrails**; predictable for operational planning.”

In other words, with regards to the aviation industry, **there exists intent in the measure that they want to** _**produce more contrail-induced cirrus clouds**_ **which inevitably tinkers the Earth’s atmosphere**.

To Lee, this was a smoking gun, as he started to see **intent** with regards to this **“nefarious agenda,”** as he put it, but needed more evidence to prove it.

The [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/) in the U.S. under the Obama Administration was trying t**o regulate greenhouse gases coming out of airplane emissions using the [Clean Air Act](https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview)**. Lee called for a **public hearing** with the EPA on the matter.

An ‘**[EPA Hearing on Commercial Aircraft Emissions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_OI7NcKhLI)**’ was held in Washington, D.C. in August of 2015; Lee brought four other members of the “chemtrail community” who had differing opinions. “The day we all agree is the day we can all be wrong,” Lee noted in the interview.

Some **quotes** from Lee during the hearing [with **emphasis added**]:

> “**As you can see by the wording of the Clean Air Act, lead, barium, aluminum, and trade secret toxic chemicals clearly present a greater danger to public health than greenhouse gases** no matter how much climate science you accumulate.  
>   
> Furthermore, **material safety data sheets of aviation fuel and their additives almost always contain the same warning: do not dump in water. Yet, raw fuel dumping or burning these chemicals, dangerous chemicals, and then dumping them in water is somehow safe?**  
>   
> ...  
>   
> The EPA and Obama Administration are **ignoring** the **global outrage** over **the most visible climate change concern from airplanes – cloud creation**.”

He continued by stating **incomplete and inconclusive data by** **[The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)](https://www.ipcc.ch/about/)**, a United Nations body which is purportedly tasked with assessing the science related to climate change [with **emphasis added** for key points]:

> “...and we all should be concerned [about] **the EPA’s claim that CO2 is a greater threat to human health than contrails and aviation-induced cloudiness is based on incomplete IPCC data that downplays the effects of contrails on our climate**.  
>   
> The **IPCC’s fourth assessment of contrail radiative forcing only accounted for linear contrails** **– meaning any contrails that spreads out and turns into cirrus clouds was not accounted for**.   
>   
> How significant is this heat-trapping contrail conundrum? Quote: ”Contrails formed by aircraft can evolve into cirrus clouds indistinguishable from those formed naturally. **These spreading contrails may be causing more climate warming today than all the carbon dioxide emitted by aircraft since the start of aviation**.”   
>   
> ...  
>   
> Although this research has now been incorporated into the IPCC computer models and revised down, **in my opinion, these claims highlight gaping holes in climate science.** As of 2013, quote: “aerosol cloud interactions are one of the main uncertainties in climate research.”   
>   
> **Scientific understanding of how contrails transition into cirrus clouds is severely lacking**, but rapidly evolving with the **latest research showing that cirrus clouds are filled with metal aerosols from human sources**.”

Lee further states how **only a small amount of infused metal particulates can generate huge effects on cirrus cloud formations**.

He also **warns about the dangers** should these activities persist:

> “**Finally, aviation-induced cloudiness endangers future growth in solar energy, affects tourism (and spending), and is projected to make terrestrial astronomy impossible by 2050.”**

At the end of his testimony, Lee encouraged the EPA to consider expanding the scope of this endangerment to include metal particulates and clouds formation from jet exhaust inline with the spirit of the Clean Air Act. These dangers also contribute to, he adds, increased levels of Alzheimer’s disease, autism, cancer, and a “plethora of other debilitating illnesses.”

“If the EPA is truly concerned about **aviation-induced climate change**, they will **regulate the production of contrails and cirrus clouds**,” he notes, adding that increased _verification_ (of aircraft emissions) and _protection_ are a must.

A few **personal observations** are in order by this author.

James (Jim) Lee referred to **“material safety data sheets of aviation fuel and their additives”** in his testimony. In Part 2 of this series under the [whistleblowers](https://fournier.substack.com/i/137872096/whistleblowers-spill-the-beans) section, I referenced the **[revelations of former United States Air Force (USAF) Sergeant Kristen Meghan Edwards](https://fournier.substack.com/i/137872096/kristen-meghan-edwards-united-states-air-force-usaf-sergeant)** who specialises in this field and **had attested to the unsafe use and dispersion of such kinds of harmful materials by military aircraft**. She was punished for publicly speaking out about these.

Apart from commercial aviation, we should not discount the **dispersion of these harmful materials by military aircraft** – especially from the United States – since they have a [dubious track record](https://fournier.substack.com/i/137515533/covert-experimentation-on-us-human-populations) of engaging in **[weather warfare activities](https://fournier.substack.com/i/137515533/appendix-c-weather-warfare-a-short-historical-overview-of-military-programs-involved-with-geoengineering-and-weather-modification)**.

This is in addition to **other unknown and [very questionable flight operations](http://liberty-academy.org/geoengineering/communications/DOD_Media_Inquiry_About_US_Military_Stratotanker_Flight_on_2024-02-27.pdf)** which occur such as **one which I have documented – see [photos](http://liberty-academy.org/geoengineering/photos/Canada/Quebec/Sherbrooke/2024/02-27-US_Military_Stratotanker_Spraying/) and [videos](http://liberty-academy.org/geoengineering/videos/2024-02-27-Sherbrooke-US_Military_Stratotanker/) – over Canadian territory)**this past February over my own city.

Isn’t it **ironic** that the **Climate Change agenda**which advocates for the use of alternative sources of energy such as **solar**, also is largely responsible for creating mass cloud covering which blocks out the sun from reaching solar panels?

In relation to **increased levels of illnesses**, I touched upon this matter in **[Appendix F (Health effects of Sprayings and other Geoengineering Activities on our Health & the Natural Environment)](https://fournier.substack.com/i/137872096/appendix-f-health-effects-of-sprayings-and-other-geoengineering-activities-on-our-health-and-the-natural-environment)** in Part 2 of this series, citing from numerous peer-reviewed studies which attests to this troubling phenomenon.

It should also be noted, or re-emphasised, that **this testimony was from 2015 – almost a** _**decade**_ **ago**. That means that **the negative** (or, at the very least, the unknown/unmeasured effects) **consequences of these aviation-induced clouds** have **likely been exacerbating climate systems, our natural environment, food production, etc.**

**How many environmental- and health-related impact studies have been conducted by [Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/corporate/mandate.html) in regards to aircraft emissions?** If you know of any, please provide a link in the Comments section below.

Coming back to the central theme of this sub-section, namely **intent**, the Bigtree-Lee interview shifts back to how the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has opted to steer the industry towards **biofuels** for **“contrail control.”**

In other words, **to change the chemical constituents coming out of jet aircraft so that there’s “less warming, more cooling” contrails.**

Importantly, **this is an admission or confirmation that they are indeed changing the components of jet fuel for geoengineering purposes**.

Lee contacted the person in charge at the FAA who was testing the biofuels, [Dr. Rangasayi Halthore](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rangasayi-Halthore), the head of the outfits’ **Aviation Climate Change Research Initiative**, **to verify what Dr. Shumann meant by his [aforementioned] statement about “less warming, more cooling contrails.”** To which Halthore replied:

> “**We want more contrail-induced cirrus clouds by day, and none by night.”**

This statement from Halthore **clearly affirms** _**why**_ **we see less, if not almost no, trails during the evenings and at night versus day time.**

To Jim Lee, this proves _**intent**_**.** It is the **smoking-gun**, if you will, **about this greater conspiracy**.

Not conspiracy theory, but conspiracy fact, as the affirmations and evidence presented by Lee and the various authorities involved along with the related documentation readily confirm.

During the interview (at around the 30:35 mark), Lee presents the [actual correspondence between him and Dr. Halthore](https://climateviewer.com/downloads/Citizen-Inquiry-of-Contrails-Jim-Lee-and-Dr-Rangasayi-Halthore-2017.pdf) to this effect [with additional **emphasis added in red underlining**]:

As can be seen in the second question in the first image above, Halthore the expert confirms that the trails can be referred to as ‘**contrail-induced cirrus clouds**,” which affirms that **they are indeed** _**artificial**_ **clouds, i.e., produced from aircraft**.

In the third question, the FAA expert also **[confirms that soot, i.e. black carbon](https://climateviewer.com/downloads/presentations/Carbon-Black-Dust-The-Chemtrail-Secret-for-Weather-Warfare-Geoengineering-and-Ozone-Destruction.pdf) (as was shown in the first sub-section above that contains all those metals) figures among the particulates of contrails.**

In other words, **all these** **[harmful metals](https://climateviewer.com/cirruscloudsmatter/)** **are indeed present in these artificial clouds which thus become part of our shared atmosphere.**

This is indeed an incredible admission.

Moreover, **these particulates will eventually find their way to ground level over our natural environment, water supplies, crop fields, and even in the stratosphere** (where they persist for longer periods).

As such, these **pose [potential health impacts on humans (as I have documented in Part 2 of this series)](https://fournier.substack.com/i/137872096/health-impacts-on-humans)**, and also **as flammable substances, e.g., [magnesium](https://fournier.substack.com/i/137872096/magnesium),** which can find their way to forest floors that could exacerbate [forest fires](https://fournier.substack.com/p/dozens-of-very-large-forest-fires).

The **11th question** posed to Halthore by Lee along with his answer can be seen hereunder:

Halthore responds to Lee’s question about what Ulrich Shumann meant by **“less warming, more cooling contrails,”** by stating **“We would like to have more CICs [i.e., Contrail-Induced Cirrus clouds] during day and none during night.”**

For those who would argue that Halthore used “**would**,” as to imply that this is merely something they would _like_ to do but is actually _not_ actually taking place, they would be incorrect; for, in a post on his Substack (titled [Geoengineering with Contrails](https://climateviewer.substack.com/p/geoengineering-with-contrails) from Feb. 12, 2024) Lee confirms that **this ambition is indeed taking place**, as per the work of the **[Royal Aeronautical Society](https://www.aerosociety.com/news/easy-does-it-for-greener-skies/)**([RaeS](https://twitter.com/AeroSociety), based in London).

This can be further **cross-checked** from **Canada’s very own University of Toronto’s [Institute for Aerospace Studies](https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/)’ [7thInternational Workshop on Aviation and Climate Change](https://www.utias.utoronto.ca/7th-international-workshop/)** which states that on Friday May 21, 2021, **John Green** presented the **[RAeS Conference Report: Mitigating the Climate Impact of Non-CO2 – Aviation’s Low-Hanging Fruit](http://goldfinger.utias.utoronto.ca/IWACC5/IWACC7/Green.pdf)** which points to the same presentation that Jim’s page links to.

The following slide from that **[presentation](http://goldfinger.utias.utoronto.ca/IWACC5/IWACC7/Green.pdf)**(archived [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240212010119/http://goldfinger.utias.utoronto.ca/IWACC5/IWACC7/Green.pdf)) **confirms the idea and work on the ‘warm versus cool contrails’**:

A subsequent **briefing paper** by the **Royal Aeronautical Society** – **[CONTRAILS AND CONTRAIL MANAGEMENT, Greener by Design Specialist Group](https://www.aerosociety.com/media/20657/contrails-and-contrail-management-briefing-paper.pdf)** **from April 2023** also attests to the **contrail management techniques**.

This paper also confirms that **jet exhaust contains soot (black carbon)** and helps to explain what is technically referred to as “**persistent contrails.**” In section 2. FORMATION OF CONTRAILS AND CONTRAIL-INDUCED CIRRUS CLOUD, they state [with **emphasis added**]:

> “if the aircraft is flying through a region of air that is supersaturated with respect to ice (ISSR – ice supersaturated region), the contrail will not only contain ice from the exhaust water vapour, but also water vapour from the surrounding atmosphere. In this case, a **‘persistent’ contrail** forms, with its characteristic very long twin parallel white lines, caused by the ice crystals being trapped in the aircraft’s trailing vortex system. **Persistent contrails can be hundreds of kilometres long, with a lifetime of several hours. As the contrail ages, it may develop into contrail cirrus, the twin parallel lines disappear, but lenticular cloud or clouds remain.**”

This passage helps us lay folk to understand and confirm two things:

1. That **cirrus clouds** are indeed **the** _**result**_ **of the aircraft-produced contrails;**
    
2. they **persist**, i.e., **last a long time (several hours)**, and can **stretch over long distances (hundreds of kilometres)**.
    

But what I find particularly noteworthy and telling of this, _more recent_, briefing paper is that it appears to **admit that contrails and contrail-induced cirrus clouds from aircraft have a greater net warming effect than their CO2 emissions**.

The **Introduction** section reads [with original emphasis]:

> “Until very recently, the aviation industry has been focused on CO2. This is because, at the global level, it is the most important greenhouse gas, the warming effect of CO2 emissions being long-lasting and, hence, cumulative. In addition to developing new technologies and designs to reduce conventional kerosene use and, hence, reducing CO2 emissions, industry and governments are concentrating on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), electric, hydrogen and hybrid propulsion and ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). **However, it is now time to also consider the largest net warming component of aviation’s emissions, namely contrails and contrail-induced cirrus clouds** – in addition to continuing the CO2 mitigation strategies.”

**Page 3** of the paper also highlights the following quote:
