This is the reddit post where [[Ian Carrol]] found  [bedrock](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/owrq55/will_the_real_gme_bbemg_please_stand_up_part_1/) here it explains in VERY simple terms, visuals that Corporations are OWNED BY corporations that’s owned by corporations that’re owned by corps…etc…

So you can understand what is shown below

Buuuut to try make it so u can skip the WHOLE explanation, 
1st is the name, 
2nd is who owns the named, 
3rd is a breakdown of who owns the 2nd, 
4th, I’m black is showing that all corps own corps, the white is retail investors (you & me) & grey are insiders like directors, CEOs etc... 
(Conclusion: the banks own us!)

Hopefully [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/owrnzl/will_the_real_gme_bbemg_please_stand_up_part_1/) reddit post never gets taken down, which outlines the whole concept,
however, here is a brilliant example to be able to understand what is going on.

# 2.1.1 Mr. Hankey The Christmas Poo

Let's say I own an investment company named **Money Inc**.. I’m competing for investor monies with my friend Cartman who owns **Fat Money**. Down the street is a former friend of ours named Kenny. He owns **Money Castle.** Kenny is short, has a speech impediment, and steals some of our customers sometimes.

On the edge of town there is a really nice big fat juicy new up and comer company named **HankeyPoo** that I want to invest in. I really like the stock so I buy 20% of the company. I tell Cartman about it and he agrees with my assessment. He buys 20% as well. Unfortunately Kenny got (down) wind and buys up another 20%. As much as I don’t like Kenny, he does have a nose for investment opportunities. HankeyPoo now has 60% institutional ownership. Combined our ownership gives us a lot of control over what kind of shit goes on at the company if we choose to use our "Poo" leverage, though there is little apparent motivation for us to work together since we are obviously competitors. The rest of the town loves HankeyPoo. They seem to think his shit don’t stink and scoop up 20% of “The Poo” (Retail). Hankey decided to keep 20% of The Poo in house (Insider).

Here are ownership maps of what these four companies look like:

These pictures are created by an ownership Treemap program I wrote. The code and the database can be [found on github](https://github.com/Slyver12/iterative_treemap_megacorp). A Treemap is a graphical display of data that shows a distribution by percent of something in 2D rectangles. In this case it is relative percent ownership of voting stock. Each sub-rectangle is, by area, a percent of the area of the whole square. For example, in the case of HankeyPoo above it shows that Money Inc (red), Fat Money (green), Money Castle (blue), Retail (white) and Insider (gray, Mr. Hankey himself) all own 20% each of the voting stock of HankeyPoo since their area is in each case 20% of the area of the larger containing square. By contrast, in the case of the three investment companies above; Money Inc, Fat Money, and Money Castle, it shows that they are 100% self owned; they are clearly different companies.

Pleased with my HankeyPoo investment, and having some extra cash, I look elsewhere for investment opportunities. I’ve always really liked Cartman’s company. He may be a slob, but he’s a savvy slob. I decide to buy up a third of the total shares in his company. Being nice, I let him know. He decides that’s a good idea and buys up 33% of mine as well. Neither of us like Kenny very much so we each decide to snag up as much of his company as we can. We buy out 33% each for a total of 66% ownership. Unbeknownst to us, Kenny, being not as stupid as we thought despite his speech impediment, bought up 33% of each of our companies as well.

As far as HankeyPoo is concerned, we each still own 20% of that company, even though we only own 33% of our own company. For example; I own 1/5 of 1/3 = 1/15 through my own company, and 1/5 of 1/3 through both Cartman’s and Kenny’s companies. That’s 1/15 + 1/15 + 1/15 = 3/15 = 1/5 = 20%. Together we still own 60% and the voting majority. Here is the new ownership treemap:

While I may still be CEO of my company Money Inc., I have to respect that I have broader interests now. It behooves me to coordinate and work with both Cartman and unfortunately Kenny since its really difficult to tell, by ownership anyways, who owns which company. As far as how invested we are in both each other and HankeyPoo, we might as well be one company with three different “investor” doors and one “retail” door.

If HankeyPoo does well (and we’ll make sure it does, with "brown gift bags" at Christmas time) we will have plenty of money to invest in other companies in the same manner; all coordinating for the best interests of each other and of course the corporations we deem worthy. For any companies we don’t like, maybe just because they won’t sell us controlling interest, or we just think their shit stinks, we’ll have the capital to short them out of existence. Any competition to the corporations we own gets deleted if they choose not to join us. If they play ball, they can join our “free market”. All we would need to ensure a dominant victory in our little version of “capitalism” is a little help from the media to drive appropriate emotional responses from the public; lean them towards a company or away from it with selective advertising. It’s a good thing our companies already own the local news paper!

For a simple example I will show this iterative “actual ownership” replacement for HankeyPoo Inc.

Using this same process for BlackRock it looks something like this:![[BlkRok(Bdrk).jpg]]

If that doesn't make sense, here is a simply explained video:
