#### Unity or Unreal
Easier for plugging in graphs, floating files

Displaying information geographically on a map or on a timeline

perhaps better for a later stage, once we have the spec

Easier to be integrated into oculus 
### Obsidian
Easy to get a very smoothly integrated first iteration of a 3d knowledge graph 

Unique graphs, representations etc... would need to be coded
