Globalism is good

Globalists are bad

  

Globalism is the concept that the species works together, in my mind, of course, this could somewhat extend to more than just earth once space travel is attained, however it certainly is not around the corner as certain people would have you assume. 

  

Globalists are terrible, from the track record of the humans that self-define as “globalist”, there has been a distinct lack of regard for the average human and an even larger regard for themselves. With misappropriated assets left, right & centre in government, along with policy being in almost complete deliberate hate for the average person. Since the average are the majority & there are quite deliberate wants for them to be culled or reduced in number by orders of the billions. 

  

Of course neither can be sustained. Except in imagination. So seeing as we have identified such a paradox, let’s investigate the truthfulness of the allegation. If someone says they’ll kill everyone, or at least a 

large enough number that you, I & everyone we’ve met is dead; is it just a miss-speak, is it just a threat, is it deliberate fear mongering to usurp power, is it a order, is it a meaningful play in a game to the highest player or a meaningless play in a game to the highest player. 

  

Perhaps there is less to life than is seen. Perhaps it’s all 1 huge misdirect & misappropriation of resources, funds, etc… At least for all to be able to community, science & art then it is necessary for a LOT of resources to be re-aligned. Perhaps human time the most important. Yes, warehouses & resources must flow, and must not be stopped, but if 1 warehouse is poisoning the populous & making more money than 50 warehouses keeping the populous alive or 1 office is, because they organise something, if we were to work together somewhat openly, instead of constant back-stabbing for the sake of personal wealth, is this the key to success, before re-evaluation. 

  

The only other alternative that I fear truly, which sort of makes me think I must believe in it is the concept that humans must be tamed, the reason we can’t work together is that if we all had the freedom I speak off we would not be able to handle it. However, even writing & pondering this lightly, makes me strengthened in my resolve in opposition. 

  

If we’ve been able to work together in small teams in the past, can we not continue today, is there any way that by being leaders who openly share their actions with the utmost investigation to make sure the funds are appropriately used. Not only on their own, but with teams of financial analysts with full access to the spending of such powers, whilst also being given the exact same amount of power as the average human, not the dosser. Is it possible we could all become somewhat the philosopher dosser communist. 

  

I would suppose a natural course of events to allow the aforementioned the ability to enact the influence upon their bosses would be the connection to consistent analytics, at all times, notes providing instant updates. I would propose that a powerful enough hub of central computers with decentralised repeaters could serve as the crutch of a continued civilisation. 

  

Each of these users being empowered with visualisation of resources being instantly drawn by the data input by professionals on the ground, as to what was moving where, keeping transport to a minimum, with access to a consistent heads up display, that would allow much more efficient visualisation of each specific asset in a resource pipeline. 

  

Yes, fraud is pervasive, extremely, to an extent few could imagine, holding each individual to account is barely the issue, when perhaps 0.1% of the planet’s populous really have much control as to what gets to where. Though, it is debatable if even they have the perceived power, 

  

Since there is a possibility there is more of a steam train off the rails on ice, momentumly moving, engineers, still shovelling coal, melting the ice, causing the back of the train to be underwater, the elderly passengers drowned, the front of the train to know exactly what’s going on but enjoying the food cart, there to be a “quiet” private dining area which is just near to the front so they have no idea, being fed by the chefs that are fully aware of the shituation, being told if they don’t pull their weight, by security “you’ll be on the ice with another word”, really taking them further and further away from where they can really be free from such a wholly encapsulating reality. The trek will be lonely, cold, arduous even, but it is the only option for a realist. 

  

Jump off, who knows, there might not be a freezing death for your children, there might be a nice Eskimo. 

  

So you best keep a good eye, whilst a chef security or engineer, for they will throw you off the train if they feel like it.
