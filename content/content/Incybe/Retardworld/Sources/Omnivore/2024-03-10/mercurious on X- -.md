There is an apparent choice. [[Incybe/Retardworld/Sources/Tags/BRICS]] or the [[Incybe/Retardworld/Sources/Tags/NATO]]allegiance. Many questions need to be asked.

Is this choice between multipolarity, and unipolarity, a choice between nationalist socialism (multipolarity) involving a host of federated states and territories or universal socialism (unipolarity)?

To what extent is a federation of states and territories, respectful of the principles of NATURAL and COMMON LAW which many appear to think is based on MYTHS and LEGENDS, and to what extent does this inform the principles of sovereignty which are supposedly underwritten by NATURAL and COMMON LAW? 

Is the term socialism different to communism? 
What is a COMMUNE- community? 

What was the information protected and defended by ancient priesthoods? 
What is the information protected and defended by scientific priesthoods? 

Are we forced to chose between a better and bad version of corporate imperialism? To what extent is the NPC of the CCP directed to and managed by people who are too young to comprehend the machinations that led to the global sweep of progressive revolutionary intentions to reset and remake new world cultures from the first instance of the revolutionary spirit that seeded such ideals, and defined "progress" in the 17th century? 

To what extent does mathematical idealism and hypothetical notions of anti-realism play into the hands of those wilfully seeking to defend and protect the assumed necessity for trade secrets which extends to the use and misuse of NEW WORLD [[Incybe/Retardworld/Sources/Tags/EM]] science and its technological spin offs that have informed the development of EXTRAORDINARY weapons of mass destruction and mass disruption?
