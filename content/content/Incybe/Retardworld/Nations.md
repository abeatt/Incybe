From [[Johnny Vedmore]] the reason the Cuba crisis ever happened, was that the UK wanted the US more involved in the war, so they got a British, welsh officer, killed him, (in the war) handcuffed a briefcase, with, a map of Cuba that showed places where the Nazis had built bases, documents on his person to show this and crashed his plane of the coast of Cuba. Then his plane/bloated body was picked up by the Spanish who gave it to the Americans who passed the info to their congress who passed the first anti-Cuba bill. Basically meaning that the us then joined the war effort.

Hasbara (Hebrew: הַסְבָּרָה) has no direct English translation, but roughly means "explaining". It is a communicative strategy that "seeks to explain actions, *whether or not they are justified*". As it focuses on providing explanations about one's actions, hasbara has been called a "reactive and event-driven approach".

Reason of interest: a large majority ransom ware attack companies and hacker groups specifically were given orders not to attack or target these countries, so it is likely they have been running a secret war on the species through many other tactics.
