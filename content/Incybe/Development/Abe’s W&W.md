#### Welcome to Abe’s Weird & Wonderful ideas:
##### Add Easter eggs 
perhaps hello u cunt as first message
Every 100,000 customers/sales/1bil alterations, a 🤖 goes out that can be found for £20,000

##### Pricing model possibilities: 
implement in phone, ads, subscription, yearly, one-off with subscription to updated software, & all of above

##### Mini google search bar

## For me: (most users might like would like to have the choice)
##### Search needs to be 6digits for speed

#### Add stats of hourly pay to cube main screen

|How to do it: create a custom software that runs 3d graph mapping that could have each cell custom edited, and hold editing and a voice control feature that can transmute/tsransmit/transcribe words to the cells.|
|Next: set up a basic process of determining which code language is best, some to consider: python, Java, html|
|Output: more time for dancing, fucking and fighting, talking and singing, touching and feeling, foraging and consuming, imagining and building, a galactic race|
|Have mods that integrate with small lines of code so you can automate everything like lights, doors, windows, tvs, car doors,|
|Why get obsessed with titles when you can have like 3,4,5,6,7 words of identification|
|Advertisements|
|One advert: you’re so forgetful, booomb comes in the connector|
|Another: can you please make sure to shut the door, boooomb|
|Another: Why are there so many fuckin adverts on here, boooomb|
|Another: ‘stut fuck it’s not connecting, booomb|
|Another: “kimono” with a partially complete cube on the back that says                        “help me help you with aii” underneath|
|Glasses - James is going to be very old school, and not invest in just money markets but mate’s ideas, some people won’t be interested in this, it’s a real thinker|

#### Ai (chat gpt 2022)
13/11/2023Integrating ChatGPT into a Unity project, essentially involves setting up a connection between Unity and OpenAI's API to send and receive messages. Here's a simplified overview of the process:

1. **OpenAI API Key**: First, you'll need an API key from OpenAI. This key is necessary to authenticate your requests to the ChatGPT model.
2. 2. **Unity Project Setup**:

    - Create a new Unity project or open an existing one.

    - You might need to install additional packages like `Newtonsoft.Json` for JSON parsing.
3. 3. **Networking in Unity**:

    - Unity uses `UnityWebRequest` for HTTP requests. You'll use this to send POST requests to the OpenAI API.

    - Create a C# script in Unity to handle these requests.

    - In the script, define a method to send a POST request to the OpenAI API endpoint with the user's input and your API key.
4. 4. **Handling Responses**:

    - The response from OpenAI will be in JSON format. Parse this response to extract the ChatGPT response.

    - Display this response in your Unity application, for instance in a UI text element.
5. 5. **User Interface**:

    - Create a simple UI where users can type their queries and view ChatGPT's responses.

    - This could include an input field for the query, a button to send the query, and a text area to display the response.
6. 6. **Testing and Debugging**:

    - Thoroughly test the application to ensure that requests are sent correctly and responses are properly received and displayed.

    - Handle any errors that might occur during the request and response process.
7. 7. **Optimization and Security**:

    - Ensure that your API key is stored securely and not exposed to users.

    - Optimize the networking code to handle latency and potential disconnects.
8. 8. **Compliance with OpenAI's Usage Policies**:

    - Make sure your application complies with OpenAI's usage policies and guidelines.

  

Remember that handling network requests and parsing JSON can be complex, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations in Unity. It's important to handle these aspects carefully to ensure a smooth user experience.
