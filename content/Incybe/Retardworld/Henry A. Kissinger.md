[Heinz Alfred Kissinger](https://www.thoughtco.com/henry-kissinger-biography-4179026) was born in Bavaria, Germany, on 27 May 1923 to Paula and Louis Kissinger. The family had been one of many Jewish families fleeing the persecution in Germany to arrive in America in 1938. Kissinger would change his first name to Henry at 15 years old when arriving in America by way of a brief emigration to London. His family would initially settle in Upper Manhattan with the young Henry Kissinger attending George Washington High School. In 1942, Kissinger would enroll in the City College of New York, but, in early 1943, was drafted into the US Army. On 19 June 1943, Kissinger would become a naturalised US citizen. He would soon be assigned to the 84th Infantry Division where he would be recruited by the legendary [](https://www.worldsecuritynetwork.com/Other/tillmann-dietrich-1/Who-was-Dr.-Fritz-Kraemer)[Fritz Kraemer](https://www.worldsecuritynetwork.com/Other/tillmann-dietrich-1/Who-was-Dr.-Fritz-Kraemer) to work in the military intelligence unit of the division. Kraemer would fight along Kissinger during the Battle of the Bulge and would later become extremely influential in American politics during the postwar era, influencing future politicians such as Donald Rumsfeld. Henry Kissinger would describe Kraemer as being “the greatest single influence on my formative years”, in a _New Yorker_ article entitled, [](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/18/the-myth-of-henry-kissinger)[The Myth of Henry Kissinger](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/18/the-myth-of-henry-kissinger), written in 2020.

The writer of that article, [](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/thomas-meaney)[Thomas Meaney](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/thomas-meaney), describes Kraemer as:

> “_A Nietzschean firebrand to the point of self-parody—he wore a monocle in his good eye to make his weak eye work harder—Kraemer claimed to have spent the late Weimar years fighting both Communists and Nazi Brown Shirts in the streets. He had doctorates in political science and international law, and pursued a promising career at the League of Nations before fleeing to the US in 1939. He warned Kissinger not to emulate “cleverling” intellectuals and their bloodless cost-benefit analyses. Believing Kissinger to be “musically attuned to history,” he told him, “Only if you do not ‘calculate’ will you really have the freedom which distinguishes you from the little people.””_

During World War II, whilst Kissinger was serving in the U.S. Counter-Intelligence Corps, he would be promoted to the rank of sergeant and would go on to serve in the Military Intelligence Reserve for many years after peace was declared. During that period, Kissinger would take charge of a team hunting down Gestapo officers and other Nazi officials who had been labeled as “saboteurs”. After the war, in 1946, Kissinger would be reassigned to teach at the European Command Intelligence School, a position he would continue to work in as a civilian after officially leaving the army.

In 1950, Kissinger would graduate from Harvard with a degree in political science where he would study under [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Yandell_Elliott)[William Yande](https://www.howold.co/person/william-yandell-elliott/biography)[ll Elliott](https://www.howold.co/person/william-yandell-elliott/biography), who would eventually be a political advisor to six US presidents and would also serve as a mentor to Zbigniew Brzezinski and Pierre Trudeau, among others. Yandell Elliott, along with many of his star pupils, would serve as [the key connectors](https://www.amazon.com/New-World-Order-Strategy-Imperialism/dp/1634240901) between the American national security establishment and the British “Round Table” movement, embodied by organisations such as Chatham House in the UK and the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States. They would also seek to impose global power structures shared by Big Business, the political elite and academia. Kissinger would continue to study at Harvard, gaining his MA and PhD degrees at the prestigious university, but he was also already trying to forge a career path in intelligence, reportedly [](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1979/11/03/111114134.html?pageNumber=19)[seeking recruitment as an FBI spy](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1979/11/03/111114134.html?pageNumber=19) during this period.

In 1951, Kissinger would be employed as a consultant for the Army’s [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_Research_Office)[Operations Research Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_Research_Office), where he would be trained in various forms of psychological warfare. This awareness of psyops was reflected in his doctoral work during the period. His work on the Congress of Vienna and its consequences invoked thermonuclear weapons as its opening gambit, which also made an otherwise dull piece of work a little more interesting. By 1954, Kissinger was hoping to become a junior professor at Harvard but, instead, the dean of Harvard at the time, McGeorge Bundy – another pupil of William Yandell Elliott, recommended Kissinger to the [](http://conspiracy-gov.com/the-new-world-order/council-on-foreign-relations)[Council on Foreign Relations](http://conspiracy-gov.com/the-new-world-order/council-on-foreign-relations) (CFR). At the CFR, Kissinger would start managing a study group on nuclear weapons. From 1956 to 1958, Kissinger also became the Director of Special Studies for the [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Brothers_Fund)[Rockefeller Brothers Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Brothers_Fund) (David Rockefeller was vice-president of the CFR during this period), as well as going on to direct multiple panels to produce reports on national defense, which would gain international attention. In 1957, Kissinger would seal his place as a leading Establishment figure on thermonuclear war after publishing, [](https://archive.org/details/nuclearweaponsfo00kiss)[Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy](https://archive.org/details/nuclearweaponsfo00kiss), a book published for the Council on Foreign Relations by Harper & Brothers.

In December of 1966, The Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, John M Leddy, announced the formation of a [](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1966/12/16/issue.html)[22-man panel](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1966/12/16/issue.html) of advisors to help “shape European policy”. The five most prominent actors of this panel of advisors included: Henry A Kissinger representing Harvard, [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Osgood)[Robert Osgood](https://www.nndb.com/people/563/000399363/) of the Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research (funded by Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie money), [](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-politics/article/abs/canada-and-continental-defense-melvin-conant-the-long-polar-watch-canada-and-the-defense-of-north-america-new-york-harper-brothers-1962-pp-204-500/2AEBEE4CC7A9230DFA55A8DF1B12331B)[Melvin Conant](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-politics/article/abs/canada-and-continental-defense-melvin-conant-the-long-polar-watch-canada-and-the-defense-of-north-america-new-york-harper-brothers-1962-pp-204-500/2AEBEE4CC7A9230DFA55A8DF1B12331B) of Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_R._Schilling)[Warner R Schilling](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Warner-R-Schilling-2170641416) of Columbia University, and [](https://www.toolshero.com/toolsheroes/raymond-vernon/)[Raymond Vernon](https://www.toolshero.com/toolsheroes/raymond-vernon/) who was also of Harvard. The other people on the panel included four members of the Council on Foreign Relations, [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_Stone)[Shepard Stone](https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/06/obituaries/shephard-stone-82-a-diplomat-a-journalist-and-a-philanthropist.html) of the Ford Foundation, with the rest being a mix of representatives from leading American universities. The forming of this panel could be considered the laying of the proverbial foundation stone marking the American branch of the “Round Table” establishment’s intent to create an organisation such as the World Economic Forum, whereby Anglo-American imperialists would mold European policies as they saw fit.

Post-war Europe was at a vital stage of its development and the powerful American Empire was beginning to see opportunities in the rebirth of Europe and the emerging identity of its younger generation. In late December of 1966, Kissinger would be one of the twenty-nine “[American authorities on Germany](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1966/12/30/issue.html)” to sign a statement declaring that “recent state elections in West Germany do not indicate a rebirth of Nazism”. The document, also signed by the likes of Dwight Eisenhower, was meant to signal that Europe was starting afresh and was meant to begin putting the horrors of European wars in the past. Some of the people involved in creating the aforementioned document were those who had already been externally influencing European policy from abroad. Notably, one of the signatures alongside Kissinger and Eisenhower was [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Morgenthau)[Prof. Hans J Morgenthau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Morgenthau) who was also representing the Council on Foreign Relations at the time. Morgenthau had famously written a paper entitled, [](https://archive.org/details/scientificmanvsp00morgrich)[Scientific Man versus Power Politics](https://archive.org/details/scientificmanvsp00morgrich), and argued against an “overreliance on science and technology as solutions to political and social problems”.

In February 1967, Henry Kissinger would target European policy making as having been the reason for a century of war and political turmoil on the continent. In a piece entitled, [](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/02/12/issue.html)[Fuller Investigation](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/02/12/issue.html), printed in the _New York Times_, Kissinger would state that a work by Raymond Aron, [](https://archive.org/details/RaymondAronPeaceAndWar)[Peace and War. A Theory of International Relations](https://archive.org/details/RaymondAronPeaceAndWar), had remedied some of these issues.

In this article, Kissinger would write:

> “_In the United States the national style is pragmatic; the tradition until World War II was largely isolationist; the approach to peace and war tended to be absolute and legalistic. American writing on foreign policy has generally tended to fall into three categories: analyses of specific cases or historical episodes, exhortations justifying or resisting greater participation in international affairs, and investigations of the legal bases of world order.”_

It was clear that Prof Henry A Kissinger had identified American involvement in European policy creation as being vital in the future peace and stability of the world. At this time, Kissinger was based at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Here, the future founder of the World Economic Forum, a young Klaus Schwab, would catch the eye of Henry A Kissinger.

Kissinger [](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000560/19681204/079/0015)[was](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000560/19681204/079/0015) [the](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000560/19681204/079/0015) [executive director](https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000560/19681204/079/0015) of the International seminar, which Schwab often mentions when recollecting his time spent at Harvard. On 16 April 1967, it would be reported that various Harvard programs had been receiving funding from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). This included [](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/04/16/90327325.html?pageNumber=53)[$135,000 of funding for Henry Kissinger’s International Seminar](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/04/16/90327325.html?pageNumber=53), funding which Kissinger claimed he was unaware had come from the US intelligence agency. The CIA’s involvement in funding Kissinger’s international seminar was exposed in a report by [](https://www.thecrimson.com/writer/5206/Humphrey__Doermann/)[Humphrey Doermann](https://www.thecrimson.com/writer/5206/Humphrey__Doermann/), the assistant to Franklin L Ford, who was dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science. Humphrey Doermann’s report, written in 1967, only centred on the CIA funding from between 1961 to 1966, but Kissinger’s International seminar, which had received the most funding out of all the CIA-funded Harvard programs, would still run through 1967. Klaus Schwab arrived at Harvard in 1965.

On 15 April 1967, The Harvard Crimson would publish an article, attributed to no author, concerning Doermann’s report that stated, “There were no strings attached to the aid, so the government could not directly influence research or prevent its results from being published.” The dismissive article, entitled, [](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1967/4/15/cia-financial-links-phumphrey-doermanns-report/)[CIA Financial Links](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1967/4/15/cia-financial-links-phumphrey-doermanns-report/), nonchalantly closes out by stating,”In any case, were the University to refuse to accept CIA research grants, the shadowy agency would have little trouble channeling its offers through another agrecy.” (agrecy being a pun meaning a form of intelligence).

The evidence points to Klaus Schwab having been recruited by Kissinger into his circle of “Round Table” imperialists via a CIA funded program at Harvard University. In addition, the year he graduated would also be the year in which it was revealed to have been a CIA-funded program. This CIA-funded seminar would introduce Schwab to the extremely well-connected American policy-makers who would help him create what would become the most powerful European public policy institute, the World Economic Forum.

By 1969, Kissinger would be sitting as the head of the US National Security Council, of which the sitting president, Richard Nixon would “[enhance the importance of](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/history.html#nixon)” during his administration. Kissinger was Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs between 2 December 1968 to 3 November 1975, serving concurrently as [](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1992/09/06/543492.html?pageNumber=433)[Richard Nixon’s Secretary of State](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1992/09/06/543492.html?pageNumber=433) from 22 September 1973. Kissinger would dominate the making of US foreign policy during the Nixon era and the system he would bring to the National Security Council would seek to combine features of the systems previously implemented by Eisenhower and Johnson.

Henry Kissinger, who had been one of the people to manufacture tensions between thermonuclear powers over the previous two decades, was now to act as “peacemaker” during the Nixon period. He would turn his focus to the European stand-off and would seek to relax the tensions between the West and Russia. He negotiated the [](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/salt)[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/salt) (culminating in the SALT I treaty) and the [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Ballistic_Missile_Treaty)[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Ballistic_Missile_Treaty). Kissinger was attempting to rebrand himself as a trusted statesman and diplomat.

In the second term of President Richard Nixon’s administration, their attention would turn to relations with Western Europe. Richard Nixon would describe 1973 as being the [](https://www.cvce.eu/content/publication/2002/9/30/dec472e3-9dff-4c06-ad8d-d3fab7e13f9f/publishable_en.pdf)[“Year of Europe”](https://www.cvce.eu/content/publication/2002/9/30/dec472e3-9dff-4c06-ad8d-d3fab7e13f9f/publishable_en.pdf). The United States’ focus would be on supporting the states of the [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community)[European Economic Community (EEC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community) which had become economic rivals to the US by the early 1970s. Kissinger grasped the “Year of Europe” concept and pushed an agenda, not only of economic reform, but also arguing to strengthen and revitalise what he considered to be the “[decaying force](https://www.manchesteropenhive.com/downloadpdf/9781526129383/9781526129383.00005.xml)”, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (#NATO). Throughout this period, Kissinger would also promote global governance.

Years later, Henry Kissinger would make the opening address of the World Economic Forum’s 1980 conference, [](https://duepublico2.uni-due.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/duepublico_derivate_00073283/Hiepel_European_Management_Forum.pdf)[telling the elites](https://duepublico2.uni-due.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/duepublico_derivate_00073283/Hiepel_European_Management_Forum.pdf) [at](https://duepublico2.uni-due.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/duepublico_derivate_00073283/Hiepel_European_Management_Forum.pdf) [Davos](https://duepublico2.uni-due.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/duepublico_derivate_00073283/Hiepel_European_Management_Forum.pdf): “For the first time in history, foreign policy is truly global”.
