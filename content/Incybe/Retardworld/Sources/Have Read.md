Essentially Kay @ Fortrade (have added on LinkedIn) happened to say he had been  approached by this David L Gosling pedo who dropped his towel, invited him round to his house, (Kay happened to bring his friends) then on another occasion he asked if he could take a transvestite,  referencing sexual actions with them, from seeing them on the streets of Pakistan. Then he got messages like, I should you on the bum you naughty boy, & I can introduce you to the prince. Talking about now King Charles the 3rd.
