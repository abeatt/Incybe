[[Herman Kahn]], [[Henry A. Kissinger]] and [[John K. Galbraith]] had become three of the most influential people in America with regards to thermonuclear deterrence, foreign policy creation, and public policy making, respectively. Most of the focus throughout these men’s career had been on Europe and the Cold War. However, their varying roles in other important events of the period all have the potential to easily distract researchers from other more subversive and well hidden events.

These three powerful Americans were all linked with each other in various ways, but one interesting and notable thread in particular ties these men together during the period between 1966, with the creation of the Kissinger-led [](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1966/12/16/issue.html)[22 man panel](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1966/12/16/issue.html) of advisors to help “shape European policy”, through to 1971, and the founding of the World Economic Forum. All three men were members of the Council on Foreign Relations, the American branch of the Anglo-American imperialist “Round Table” movement. Kissinger already had [](http://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb79876833/_2.pdf)[deep ties](http://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb79876833/_2.pdf) to the CFR, having been recruited by them straight after graduation. Galbraith [](https://www.cfr.org/sites/default/files/pdf/cfrcentennialbook.pdf)[had reportedly resigned his membership](https://www.cfr.org/sites/default/files/pdf/cfrcentennialbook.pdf) of the CFR in a “highly public way” in 1972, stating that the CFR was boring and telling a journalist, “Most of the proceedings involve a level of banality so deep that the only question they raise is whether one should sit through them.” Although there is no public date of when Galbraith became a member of the CFR, he had [](https://www.jstor.org/stable/i20029307)[written for their publications](https://www.jstor.org/stable/i20029307) from as early as July 1958 with “Rival Economic Theories in India,” being printed in _Foreign Affairs_, the official CFR journal/magazine. [[Herman Kahn]] could also be found publishing some of his essays through the CFR, writing the piece “[Our](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/1966-07-01/our-alternatives-europe) [Alternatives in Europe](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/1966-07-01/our-alternatives-europe)” in July 1966, and “[If Negotiations Fail](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1968-07-01/if-negotiations-fail)” in July 1968, both whilst working as an official advisor to the State Department.

Before the 1960s, these three extremely influential American intellectuals had each been deeply involved in trying to understand the problems of a postwar Europe, and mapping out the future of the war-stricken continent. Galbraith had traveled extensively throughout Europe, including studying policies in Germany during the Third Reich, and, after the collapse of Hitler’s Germany, Galbraith would go on to study the Soviet systems in much the same way. Galbraith’s influence over the future president, John F. Kennedy, from a very early age cannot be understated, and Galbraith was powerful enough to see JFK begin withdrawing troops from Vietnam on his recommendation. When Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Galbraith would be the man to draft the incoming president’s initial address to the nation, but Galbraith was soon to be pushed off to the sidelines. During the turmoil of the 1960s, Galbraith would be close with Henry Kissinger, both men being Harvard Professors, members of the CFR, and both men having the same goal of making Europe stable so that the Continent was well defended against any potential Soviet aggression.

To Galbraith and Kissinger, and also to the wider American political Establishment, Europe was the main threat to not only global stability, but also to the prevailing American hegemony in general. The relative stability in Europe during the postwar period was perceived as being due to the thermonuclear stand-off, and, from very early-on, Kissinger identified this dynamic and began to manipulate the situation for the benefit of American supremacy. Henry Kissinger was not alone in trying to understand the complex dynamics at play in relation to thermonuclear deterrence and how it affected policy making. Herman Kahn was the leading figure on thermonuclear strategic planning during the same period and Kissinger’s work concerning the same subject matter from the mid-50s onwards would see him cross paths with Kahn on many occasions.

Kahn offered Kissinger something which all politicians and policy makers crave, the ability to predict future events with relative accuracy. Kahn was a veritable prophet concerning the technological advancements of the not-so-distant future, and his work, although often stoic and bereft of human emotion, has stood up very well to the test of time. Kahn and Kissinger’s goals would overlap during the mid and late 1960s, and as the threat assessments Kahn made during this period became more optimistic, Kissinger would see Kahn’s work as being fundamental in offering a new future to the people of the world.

However, Henry Kissinger’s vision of the future was not of a free and fair society advancing into a “brave new world” together, but rather, Kissinger intended to create an image of the world which had been skewed by his own CFR-driven Establishment perspective. Although he would attempt to rebrand himself as a true statesman, Kissinger would continue to subvert not only foreign democratic processes, but also to undermine the American system for the eventual benefit of a globalist agenda. When Schwab was first recognised by Kissinger as a potential future globalist leader, the relatively young German would soon be introduced to Galbraith and Kahn. This would coincide with Kahn’s work identifying the need to specifically train individuals with leadership potential separately from those who attend the prevailing standard educational models.

Klaus Schwab speaking at the inaugural meeting of the World Economic Forum, 1971

In the year Klaus Schwab left Harvard, he was approached by [](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schmidheiny)[Peter Schmidheiny](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schmidheiny), who had just sold Escher Wyss to the Sulzer Group. Escher Wyss’ Ravensberg factory during World War II had been managed by [](https://unlimitedhangout.com/2021/02/investigative-reports/schwab-family-values/)[Schwab’s father, Eugen Schwab](https://unlimitedhangout.com/2021/02/investigative-reports/schwab-family-values/), and had been involved in making heavy water turbines for the secretive Nazi atomic bomb effort. Schwab speaks in one interview about the moment Schmidheiny called him up, saying, “You come from Harvard now and know modern management methods, help to make the integration a success”. What Klaus wouldn’t mention in that interview is that he would help Sulzer and Escher Wyss to merge, resulting in a new company called Sulzer AG. That company, where Schwab would serve as director, which would go on to break international law by aiding the South African apartheid regime in its [](https://books.google.cl/books?id=dvSX82cEqhIC&pg=PA381&lpg=PA381&dq=%22Escher+wyss%22+nuclear+weapon&source=bl&ots=5goPIGvIk-&sig=ACfU3U3HyiDGwvs6Zi_v0kPn_JBXcKKYjA&hl=es-419&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjD8-D5gJjuAhVdH7kGHUSvBVsQ6AEwDHoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q=escher&f=false)[illegal thermonuclear bomb program](https://books.google.cl/books?id=dvSX82cEqhIC&pg=PA381&lpg=PA381&dq=%22Escher+wyss%22+nuclear+weapon&source=bl&ots=5goPIGvIk-&sig=ACfU3U3HyiDGwvs6Zi_v0kPn_JBXcKKYjA&hl=es-419&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjD8-D5gJjuAhVdH7kGHUSvBVsQ6AEwDHoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q=escher&f=false).

Klaus Schwab had only just left the sphere of influence of some of the most significant experts in thermonuclear war, and within the same year as leaving Harvard, he would head up the merger of a company dealing in the propagation thermonuclear bomb technology to despotic regimes.

For many of us who don’t map out terrifying extinction scenarios, we may be left believing that apartheid South Africa gaining the nuke at this point in history would be one of the worst things that could’ve happened. But, Herman Kahn’s thermonuclear disaster scenarios had led the rotund genius to believe that, barring a disaster, sabotage, or an accident, no major nuclear power would dare fire a thermonuclear weapon as an act of aggression for the foreseeable future. In fact, the Establishment thinking had changed significantly, to the point where Herman Kahn and others were advising that, [](https://archive.org/details/ERIC_ED024124/page/n28/mode/1up?q=inherently)[in certain scenarios](https://archive.org/details/ERIC_ED024124/page/n28/mode/1up?q=inherently), making a country such as France a nuclear power could have significant benefits to security both regionally and globally, whilst also helping to reduce US defence spending.

Thermonuclear war was no longer the be all and end all of strategic defence policy, and it was in the dying embers of the 1960s where the same people who had caused all of the fear of a thermonuclear apocalypse, really did stop worrying and learnt to love the bomb.
